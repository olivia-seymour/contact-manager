# Overview

This is a simple program that allows the user to view, edit, and delete their contacts, and saves those contacts to a file. I wrote this program to familiarize myself with Python.

# Development Environment

This program was developed in Visual Studio Code, using Python 3.9. The json library is included to convert the dictionary used to and from a string.
